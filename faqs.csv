If you experience these symptoms, consult a healthcare professional for proper testing and diagnosis."
"Can children take paracetamol?","Yes, children can take paracetamol (acetaminophen) but only in age-appropriate doses. For children under 16, use liquid or chewable forms. The dose depends on the child's weight and age. Never exceed the recommended dose and always read the package instructions. Consult a pediatrician before giving any medication to children under 2 years old."

"How much water should I drink daily?","Adults should aim for about 8 glasses (64 ounces) of water daily, but individual needs vary based on activity level, climate, overall health, and body size. You may need more if you exercise, live in a hot climate, or are pregnant/breastfeeding. Listen to your body and drink when thirsty."

However, consult your healthcare provider before starting or continuing any exercise program. Avoid contact sports, activities with fall risk, and lying flat on your back after the first trimester."
"What causes headaches?","Common headache causes include tension (stress, muscle tension), dehydration, lack of sleep, eye strain, hunger, hormonal changes, certain foods, alcohol, weather changes, and medications. More serious causes require medical attention. Keep a headache diary to identify triggers and consult a doctor for frequent or severe headaches."
"How often should I get a health check-up?","Adults should have annual check-ups with their primary care physician.

Young, healthy adults may need check-ups every 2-3 years, while older adults or those with chronic conditions may need more frequent visits."
"What are the benefits of regular exercise?","Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles and bones, helps maintain healthy weight, reduces risk of chronic diseases, improves mental health and mood, enhances sleep quality, boosts energy levels, and increases longevity. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity weekly."

For infants under 3 months, any fever requires immediate medical attention."
"What foods should I avoid with high cholesterol?","Avoid foods high in saturated and trans fats: fried foods, processed meats, full-fat dairy products, baked goods made with hydrogenated oils, and foods high in dietary cholesterol like organ meats and egg yolks.

"What should I do for a minor cut?","For minor cuts: wash your hands first, stop bleeding by applying gentle pressure with a clean cloth, clean the wound with water, apply antibiotic ointment if available, cover with a sterile bandage, and keep the wound clean and dry. Watch for signs of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus) and seek medical care if needed."
"How much sleep do adults need?","Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep per night for optimal health.
